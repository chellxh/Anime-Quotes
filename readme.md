# Anime Quotes

This project is an overview of the skills I've learned so far. I have completed a Front-And Portfolio Project that is close to me and my interest in Anime. I have show-cased my skills of HTML, CSS, and JS while peeking the interest of my 8 year old son.

### This project:

- Has a deployed front-end application.
- Allows for user interaction through button clicks and form inputs.
- Makes requests to an external API.
- Has a theme and unique product design.

#### Hope you enjoy!
